A small project with regression analysis of climbers performance.

The repository includes a jupyter notebook file with analysis of data from climbers logbook https://www.8a.nu/. The scraped data form the climbers logbook, in format of a SQLite database, is available at https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook/metadata. 

The goal of the project is threefold. Firstly, personal: to practice skills with tensorflow, pandas and matplotlib: learn more and understand better their functionality. Secondly, to investigate the data for the factors that affect the climbers performance. Thirdly, to build a predictive model that will estimate the highest grade that a climber will be able to achieve.
